mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10].  If any of ebx, ecx, or the offset 0x10 results in an invalid memory address (outside the program's allocated space or in a protected area), it can lead to a segmentation fault or access violation.
